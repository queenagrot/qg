  <h2>Bark Architects</h2>
  <br />
  <p>The Bark rebrand embodies their responsive work to the Noosa landscape and surrounds. Their website was built to self-manage a vast folio of architectural projects, separating private residential work from their public work, all documented in the finest detail. Each project tells a story, incorporating initial sketches, plot stats and blueprints with the final work beautifully realised and photographed, making mention to any awards or media coverage for that project along the way. A testament to the developer, this website is a powerhouse.
