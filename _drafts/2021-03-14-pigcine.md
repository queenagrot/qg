    <p>PIG CINÉ was a non-for-profit resource that listed the variety of unusual film screening events across Brisbane in one place to increase awareness and attendance at these otherwise under-publicised events. Our website listed upcoming screening events, film festivals and programs, shooting subscribers an email with a weekly roundup and highlights. In partnership with MetroArts, we also hosted free film screenings featuring the work of both local and international film makers.
