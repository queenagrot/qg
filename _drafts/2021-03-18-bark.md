  <p>The Bark rebrand embodies their responsive work to the Noosa landscape and surrounds. This website showcases their architectural projects, separating those for private and public use. Each project tells a story, incorporating initial sketches, plot stats, blueprints and writings with the final work beautifully realised and photographed.
